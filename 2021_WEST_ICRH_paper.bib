  abstract = {Infra-red (IR) thermography is a widely used tool in fusion devices to monitor and to protect the plasma-facing component (PFC) from excessive heat loads. However, with the use of all-metal walls in fusion devices, deriving surface temperature from IR measurements has become more challenging. In this paper, an overview of infra-red measurements in the metallic tokamaks WEST and ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) is reported and the techniques carried out in the modeling and experimental fields to deal with this radiative and fully reflective environment are presented. Experimental characterizations of metallic samples in laboratory and experiments in WEST and AUG reveal that the behavior of both the emission and the reflectance can vary significantly with surface roughness, machining process and as the plasma operation progress. In parallel, the development of a synthetic IR diagnostic has allowed for a better interpretation of the IR images by assessing the reflection patterns and their origin. This has also proven that small-scale change in the emission pattern of beveled PFC can be confused with abnormal thermal events. Numerical solutions to evaluate the contribution of the reflections associated with a variable emissivity in a fully reflective and radiative environment are finally presented.},

  abstract = {One of the key missions of the Ion Cyclotron Resonant Heating (IRCH) system for WEST is to provide sufficient RF heating power in order to obtain a heat flux on the divertor target of 10MW/m2 during 1000s and 20MW/m2 during a few tens of seconds. Based on the experience acquired in Tore Supra, the ICRH system has been upgraded for long pulse operation and Edge Localized Modes (ELM) resilience. To achieve this performance, three antennas have been designed through a European collaboration and are now under fabrication at CAS/ASIPP, at the Keye Company, Hefei, in China, within the framework of the Associated Laboratory IRFM-ASIPP. This paper describes the electrical and mechanical design of the antenna, together with the main manufacturing steps and leak test procedure used for validating the water-cooled components. Accessibility and maintenance studies on WEST have been performed with the help of virtual reality. The first ICRH antenna was delivered at Cadarache in July 2016, and is foreseen to be installed on WEST in 2017.},

Modification of one antenna with triangular shields, which cover the locations where long magnetic field lines pass only one out of two (0{$\pi$})-phased antenna straps, did not influence the locally measured YW values markedly. In the experiments with antennas powered individually, poloidal profiles of YW on limiters of powered antennas show high YW close to the equatorial plane and at the very edge of the antenna top.

  abstract = {The WEST (Tungsten (W) Environment in Steady-state Tokamak) is an upgrade of Tore-Supra (TS) which aims it into an X-point magnetic configuration tokamak equipped with an actively cooled tungsten divertor. To be a platform of ITER technologies of high heat flux components testing, three sets of Ion Cyclotron Resonant Heating (ICRH) antennas have been designed to inject 9MW during 30s or 3MW during 1000s. The antenna design is based on a load resilient prototype successfully tested in Tore Supra in 2007. In order to allow continuous-wave (CW) operations, the mechanical design of the WEST ICRH antenna is emphasized on its cooling performances by designing fully active cooling structure. Two kinds of cooling water loops are used, with temperature and pressure of 70\textdegree C/30bar and 25\textdegree C/5.2bar, respectively. The hot water loop is used for the Faraday screen (FS) and the housing box (HB), while the cold water loop is used for the straps, the matching capacitors and the impedance transformer. To enhance the heat removal ability and control the pressure drop, the cooling channels in the FS and HB are drilled directly and parallel connected as much as possible. By performing the hydraulic\textendash thermal analysis, the lack of cooling efficiency was found in the front face of lateral collector where 1MW/m2 is imposed and fluid dead zones were found in some of the bars. After optimization, the cooling performance of the cooling circuit increased significantly. With a mass flow rate of 2.5kg/s, the total pressure drop is 3.1bar, and the peak temperatures on the FS and HB are 500\textdegree C and 261\textdegree C, respectively. Besides, no cavitation is found in the total cooling circuit.},

High-power long-pulse requirements motivated innovative design choices and operational methods. Over long pulses, the physics of rf waves in the plasma edge early emerged as a crucial issue that was abundantly studied and benefited from original diagnostic techniques, some of which still remain unique in the magnetic fusion community. This paper reviews ICRH technology and physics on Tore Supra, from the generators and antennas to the central plasma via the scrape-off layer. Emphasis is put on the experience gained over 20 years of experimental and theoretical activity. Lessons are drawn for next-step devices.},

One of the detectors, the Sub-Harmonic Arc Detector (SHAD) is based on the detection of the frequencies emitted in the MHz range by arcs [1], and is consequently resilient to fast load changes. A prototype has been in operation on ASDEX-Upgrade for ten years and has demonstrated its capability to detect arcs. However, to reach the safety level required by ITER, the design has to be modified to eliminate the spurious detections triggered by plasma emission in the MHz range and to enhance the sensitivity to low-voltage arcs. These improvements, which must preserve the simplicity of the system to guarantee its reliability, are based on the experience of RF arcs in resonant structures acquired on ASDEX-Upgrade and on dedicated test-benches. We present the main features of arcs in time and frequency domains and their impact on the behaviour of the SHAD system. Several technological solutions are based on these data and have to support the harsh environment of a burning plasma experiment. The shielding, the location of the detector, the reliability can be affected by the nuclear radiations. These elements are integrated in the design to make of the SHAD a primary safety system for ICRF heating.},

The others Plasma Facing Components (PFC) will also be modified and coated with W to transform Tore Supra into a fully metallic environment. Different coating techniques have been selected, taking into account the specifications of the various PFC: heat loads, complex geometries (length up to 1m) and different substrates (CuCrZr for actively cooled PFC, graphite and CFC for other components). This paper gives an overview on the different processes used and the associated validation program and concludes on the adequacy of the W coating with the WEST experimental program requirements.},

The coupling performance to the plasma and the load-tolerance have been improved, while adding Continuous Wave operation capability by introducing water cooling in the entire antenna. On the generator side, the operation class of the high power tetrodes is changed from AB to B in order to allow high power operation (up to 3 MW per antenna) under higher VSWR (up to 2:1). Reliability of the generators is also improved by increasing the cavity breakdown voltage. The control and data acquisition system is also upgraded in order to resolve and react on fast events, such as ELMs. A new optical arc detection system comes in reinforcement of the Vr/Vf and SHAD systems.},

  abstract = {Experiments have been performed under the coordination of the International Tokamak Physics Activity (ITPA) on several tokamaks, including ASDEX Upgrade (AUG), JET and DIII-D, to characterize the increased Ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF) antenna loading achieved by optimizing the position of gas injection relative to the RF antennas. On DIII-D, AUG and JET (with the ITER-Like Wall) a 50\% increase in the antenna loading was observed when injecting deuterium in ELMy H-mode plasmas using mid-plane inlets close to the powered antennas instead of divertor injection and, with smaller improvement when using gas inlets located at the top of the machine. The gas injection rate required for such improvements ( 0.7 \texttimes{} 1022 el s-1 in AUG, 1.0 \texttimes{} 1022 el s-1 in JET) is compatible with the use of this technique to optimize ICRF heating during the development of plasma scenarios and no degradation of confinement was observed when using the mid-plane or top inlets compared with divertor valves. An increase in the scrape-off layer (SOL) density was measured when switching gas injection from divertor to outer mid-plane or top. On JET and DIII-D, the measured SOL density increase when using main chamber puffing is consistent with the antenna coupling resistance increase provided that the distance between the measurement lines of sight and the injection location is taken into account. Optimized gas injection was also found to be beneficial for reducing tungsten (W) sputtering at the AUG antenna limiters, and also to reduce slightly the W and nickel (Ni) content in JET plasmas. Modeling the specific effects of divertor/top/mid-plane injection on the outer mid-plane density was carried out using both the EDGE2D-EIRENE and EMC3-EIRENE plasma boundary code packages; simulations indeed indicate that outer mid-plane gas injection maximizes the density in the mid-plane close to the injection point with qualitative agreement with the AUG SOL density measurements for EMC3-EIRENE. Field line tracing for ITER in the 15 MA Q DT = 10 reference scenario indicates that the planned gas injection system could be used to tailor the density in front the antennas. Benchmarking of EMC3-EIRENE against AUG and JET data is planned as a first step towards the ITER SOL modelling required to quantify the effect of gas injection on the SOL density in front of the antennas.},

TOPICA is a code capable of handling both the actual geometry of ion cyclotron (IC) antennas and an accurate plasma description; it can predict the performances of IC launchers with an unprecedented accuracy and numerical efficiency, validated against data measured in plasma operation conditions. In the reported upgrade, a new multi-cavity approach is introduced, producing significant savings in terms of CPU and memory requirements and allowing the analysis of large antennas even with limited computational resources. In fact, by formally separating the structure's cavities with a number of mathematical surfaces called `apertures', the method of moments interaction matrix is block-wise sparse and, as a consequence, can be manipulated with a far higher numerical efficiency; this also allows an out-of-core solution.},

When powering ICRH, core contamination by metallic impurities systematically results in an increase of the power radiated, often hardening the achievement of long discharges in H-mode at high power. The radiofrequency (RF) sheaths are excited mainly at proximity of ICRF antennas, resulting in an increase of metallic impurity sources. In the presence of RF sheaths, we show that most of the power reaching the wall can become carried by ions. Therefore, both heat loads and material sputtering are the result of ion fluxes on the various plasma facing components, such that some analogy between both phenomena can be made. By combining infrared with spectroscopic measurements, we show experimental evidences from WEST of RF-induced heat fluxes and their correlation with local production of impurity.},
